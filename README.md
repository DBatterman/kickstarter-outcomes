Looking at the outcomes of kickstarter data based on launch date and goals

## Overview and Analysis 

The purpose of this project was to help our client successfuly launch a kickstarter campaign for her upcoming play. To do this, we analyzed data from various fundraising efforts across different timetables and for different subjects so we can give our client the best chance for success. This particular analysis 

## Analysis and Challenges 

## Results 

###### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?

The first conclusion that I can draw is that the best month to launch a theater based kickstarter is May. Roughly 67% of campaigns were successful during this month across the years spanned in our data were successful. June was the second best month at 65%, so it's likely that early summer is the best time for these campaigns. The second conclusion is the flip side - December is the worse month to start a campaign. Only 49% of kickstarters were funded in December, likely due to people spending money for the holidays.

###### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

It seems like the most successful ranges for plays are either very small or relatively large. The best range is around $5000 or less, followed by 35000 to 45000. 

###### What are some limitations on the dataset?



###### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs we can create?
